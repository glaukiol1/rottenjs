## What is RottenJS ?
RottenJS is a light-weight Javascript library for DOM manipulation and UI development. It is named 'Rotten' because it is not that sustainable and it is not well-built at all. Having to contain features that are old-school or outdated from old libraries/frameworks like Backbone or jQuery, RottenJS doesn't actually have a real use case. But, if you are interested in experimental or open-source projects, or a library that is lightweight and decent enough for small projects, RottenJS is a good library for you!

## Getting started
### Installation
You can clone RottenJS with git:

	git clone https://github.com/nguyenphuminh/RottenJS.git

Or install it in npm:

	npm i rottenjs

Or you can just pull it from unpkg.com by adding this to your .html file:

	<script src="https://unpkg.com/rottenjs@1.1.5/rotten.min.js"></script>

### Add RottenJS to your project
Add this tag to the 'head' tag of your .html files:

	<script src='rotten.min.js' type='text/javascript'></script>

Again, you can add this block of code rather than the one above:

	<script src="https://unpkg.com/rottenjs@1.1.5/rotten.min.js"></script>
