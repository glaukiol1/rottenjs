## What is RottenJS ?
RottenJS is a light-weight Javascript library for DOM manipulation and UI development. It is named 'Rotten' because it is not that sustainable and it is not well-built at all. Having to contain features that are old-school or outdated from old libraries/frameworks like Backbone or jQuery, RottenJS doesn't actually have a real use case. But, if you are interested in experimental or open-source projects, or a library that is lightweight and decent enough for small projects, RottenJS is a good library for you!

## Getting started
### Installation
You can clone RottenJS with git:

	git clone https://github.com/nguyenphuminh/RottenJS.git

Or install it in npm:

	npm i rottenjs

Or you can just pull it from unpkg.com by adding this to your .html file:

	<script src="https://unpkg.com/rottenjs@1.1.6/rotten.min.js"></script>

### Add RottenJS to your project
Add this tag to the 'head' tag of your .html files:

	<script src='rotten.min.js' type='text/javascript'></script>

Again, you can add this block of code rather than the one above:

	<script src="https://unpkg.com/rottenjs@1.1.6/rotten.min.js"></script>

### [Functions and methods](DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
<li>Extremely lightweight.</li>
<li>Prebuilt with decent modules.</li>

### Cons
<li>Not suitable for large projects.</li>
<li>Outdated.</li>
<li>Small community.</li>

## Comparision with other libraries/frameworks
### Vue, React & Angular
Vue, React, Angular, <i>AngularJS</i> have way better usablities and capabilities then RottenJS. They far outweight RottenJS in any use cases.

### Backbone, jQuery
RottenJS shares similarities with two of those libraries, though unlike jQuery, RottenJS only targets one element through one selector, whereas in jQuery, you can targets many elements.

Backbone and jQuery are some what better than RottenJS, but RottenJS is way more lighter and is prebuilt with modules like rottenUI and rotDev which improves your development experiences and it is suitable for small or medium-scale projects.

### Redom
Redom and RottenJS are both very lightweight libraries. But Redom is suitable for modern projects, whereas RottenJS is good for small projects that needs DOM handling and manipulations.
